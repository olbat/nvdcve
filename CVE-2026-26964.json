      "value": "Windmill is an open-source developer platform for internal code: APIs, background jobs, workflows and UIs. Versions 1.634.6\n and below allow non-admin users to obtain Slack OAuth client secrets, which should only be accessible to workspace administrators. The GET /api/w/{workspace}/workspaces/get_settings endpoint returns the slack_oauth_client_secret to any authenticated workspace member, regardless of their admin status. It is expected behavior for non-admin users see a redacted version of workspace settings, as some of them are necessary for the frontend to behave correctly even for non-admins. However, the Slack configuration should not be visible to non-admins. This is a legacy issue where the setting was stored as a plain value instead of using $variable indirection, and it was never added to the redaction logic. This issue has been fixed in version 1.635.0."
