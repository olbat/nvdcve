      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/MCE: Always save CS register on AMD Zen IF Poison errors\n\nThe Instruction Fetch (IF) units on current AMD Zen-based systems do not\nguarantee a synchronous #MC is delivered for poison consumption errors.\nTherefore, MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV] will not be set. However, the\nmicroarchitecture does guarantee that the exception is delivered within\nthe same context. In other words, the exact rIP is not known, but the\ncontext is known to not have changed.\n\nThere is no architecturally-defined method to determine this behavior.\n\nThe Code Segment (CS) register is always valid on such IF unit poison\nerrors regardless of the value of MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV].\n\nAdd a quirk to save the CS register for poison consumption from the IF\nunit banks.\n\nThis is needed to properly determine the context of the error.\nOtherwise, the severity grading function will assume the context is\nIN_KERNEL due to the m->cs value being 0 (the initialized value). This\nleads to unnecessary kernel panics on data poison errors due to the\nkernel believing the poison consumption occurred in kernel context."
