You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a â€˜fromâ€™ statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation."
