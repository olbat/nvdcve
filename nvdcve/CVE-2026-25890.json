      "value": "File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to 2.57.1, an authenticated user can bypass the application's \"Disallow\" file path rules by modifying the request URL. By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted files. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.57.1."
