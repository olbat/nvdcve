      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: suspend array while updating raid_disks via sysfs\n\nIn raid1_reshape(), freeze_array() is called before modifying the r1bio\nmemory pool (conf->r1bio_pool) and conf->raid_disks, and\nunfreeze_array() is called after the update is completed.\n\nHowever, freeze_array() only waits until nr_sync_pending and\n(nr_pending - nr_queued) of all buckets reaches zero. When an I/O error\noccurs, nr_queued is increased and the corresponding r1bio is queued to\neither retry_list or bio_end_io_list. As a result, freeze_array() may\nunblock before these r1bios are released.\n\nThis can lead to a situation where conf->raid_disks and the mempool have\nalready been updated while queued r1bios, allocated with the old\nraid_disks value, are later released. Consequently, free_r1bio() may\naccess memory out of bounds in put_all_bios() and release r1bios of the\nwrong size to the new mempool, potentially causing issues with the\nmempool as well.\n\nSince only normal I/O might increase nr_queued while an I/O error occurs,\nsuspending the array avoids this issue.\n\nNote: Updating raid_disks via ioctl SET_ARRAY_INFO already suspends\nthe array. Therefore, we suspend the array when updating raid_disks\nvia sysfs to avoid this issue too."
