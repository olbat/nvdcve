An attacker with a CVAT account can access webhook delivery information for any webhook registered on the CVAT instance, including that of other users. For each delivery, this contains information about the event that caused the delivery, typically including full details about the object on which an action was performed (such as the task for an \"update:task\" event), and the user who performed the action. In addition, the attacker can redeliver any past delivery of any webhook, and trigger a ping event for any webhook. Upgrade to CVAT 2.18.0 or any later version."
