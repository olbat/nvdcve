Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239."
