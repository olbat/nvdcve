Dragonfly uses JWT to verify user. However, the secret key for JWT, \"Secret Key\", is hard coded, which leads to authentication bypass. An attacker can perform any action as a user with admin privileges. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.0.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
