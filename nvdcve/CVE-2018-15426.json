The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."
