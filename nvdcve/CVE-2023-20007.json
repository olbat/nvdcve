The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition."
