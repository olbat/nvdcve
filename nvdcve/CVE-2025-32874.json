          "value": "An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0. A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication."
