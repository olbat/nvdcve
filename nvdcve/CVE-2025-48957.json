A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue."
