Prior to 9.11.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component. In affected versions, expressions wrapped in {{ & }} were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field is displayed.
