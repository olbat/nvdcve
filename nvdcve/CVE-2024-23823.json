The vantage6 server has no restrictions on CORS settings. It should be possible for people to set the allowed origins of the server.  The impact is limited because v6 does not use session cookies. This issue has been addressed in commit `70bb4e1d8` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
