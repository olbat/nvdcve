The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid credentials on an affected device and know the password for the cli test-commands command."
