      "value": "FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. In version 1.4.0, a regression allowed folder visibility/ownership to be inferred from folder names. Low-privilege users could see or interact with folders matching their username and, in some cases, other usersâ€™ content. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.0, where it introduces explicit per-folder ACLs (owners/read/write/share/read_own) and strict server-side checks across list, read, write, share, rename, copy/move, zip, and WebDAV paths."
