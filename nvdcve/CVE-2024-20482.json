To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on the device that is configured with a custom read-only role.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of role permissions in part of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a write operation on the affected part of the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify certain parts of the configuration."
