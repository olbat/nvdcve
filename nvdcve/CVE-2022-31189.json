When an \"Internal System Error\" occurs in the JSPUI, then entire exception (including stack trace) is available. Information in this stacktrace may be useful to an attacker in launching a more sophisticated attack. This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. This issue has been fixed in version 6.4. users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the display of error messages in their internal.jsp file."
