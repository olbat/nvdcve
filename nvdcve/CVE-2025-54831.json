      "value": "Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a \"write-only\" model for sensitive values.\n\n\nIn Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4."
