The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of the ACL that is tied to the RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the device using RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
