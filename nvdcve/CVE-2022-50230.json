This simple fix is therefore\n  preferred for -stable backporting ]\n\nOn a system that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap\nis denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result,\nidmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing\n__idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs."
