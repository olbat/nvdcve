      "value": "Rejected reason: After careful review of CVE-2024-5203, it has been determined that the issue is not exploitable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the exploit assumes that the attacker has access to a session code parameter that matches a cookie on the Keycloak server. However the attacker does not have access to the cookie, and can therefore not craft a malicious request."
