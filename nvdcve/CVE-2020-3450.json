The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data that is stored in the underlying database, including hashed user credentials. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials."
