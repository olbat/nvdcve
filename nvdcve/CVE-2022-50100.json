However, a parallel wakeup from udev\nrunning on another CPU that does not share CPU cache observes p->on_cpu and\nuses task_cpu(p), queues the task on the old CPU and triggers the warning.\n\nCheck that the wakee task that is descheduling is still allowed to run\non its current CPU and if not, wait for the descheduling to complete\nand select an allowed CPU."
