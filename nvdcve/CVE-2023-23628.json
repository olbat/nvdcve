Sandboxed users shouldn't be able to view data about other Metabase users anywhere in the Metabase application. However, when a sandbox user views the settings for a dashboard subscription, and another user has added users to that subscription, the sandboxed user is able to view the list of recipients for that subscription. This issue is patched in versions 0.43.7.1, 1.43.7.1, 0.44.6.1, 1.44.6.1, 0.45.2.1, and 1.45.2.1. There are no workarounds."
