The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass Cisco FMC Software security restrictions and gain access to the underlying filesystem of the affected device."
