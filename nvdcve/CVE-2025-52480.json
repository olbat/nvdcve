Prior to version 1.9.5, if the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential remote code execution. Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5 to receive a patch. All prior versions are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available."
