      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: reset sparse-read state in osd_fault()\n\nWhen a fault occurs, the connection is abandoned, reestablished, and any\npending operations are retried. The OSD client tracks the progress of a\nsparse-read reply using a separate state machine, largely independent of\nthe messenger's state.\n\nIf a connection is lost mid-payload or the sparse-read state machine\nreturns an error, the sparse-read state is not reset. The OSD client\nwill then interpret the beginning of a new reply as the continuation of\nthe old one. If this makes the sparse-read machinery enter a failure\nstate, it may never recover, producing loops like:\n\n  libceph:  [0] got 0 extents\n  libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0\n  libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read\n  libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0\n  libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read\n\nTherefore, reset the sparse-read state in osd_fault(), ensuring retries\nstart from a clean state."
