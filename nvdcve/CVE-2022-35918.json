Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file or overwrite existing files on the web-server. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
