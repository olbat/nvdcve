Exploitation\nrequires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file within the software.\nIf exploited, a threat actor could execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nThe software must run under the context of the administrator in order to cause\nworse case impact. This is reflected in the Rockwell CVSS score, as AT:P."
