The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface improperly validates user input for specific SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with valid administrative credentials and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view information that they are not authorized to view, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, or delete information from the database that they are not authorized to delete."
