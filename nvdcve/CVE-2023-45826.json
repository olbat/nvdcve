An authenticated attacker can send a carefully crafted POST request to `/api/jsonrpc` to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability. Confidentiality is impacted as it allows for dumping information from the database. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4-beta-4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
