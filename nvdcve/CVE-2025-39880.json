      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info\n\nThere is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and\nanother place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without\nchecking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).\n\nOn 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter,\nso such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of\n0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the\nside effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive\nfetching of new tickets.\n\ncon->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that\nit's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily\nit's not something that happens often."
