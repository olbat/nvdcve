Threat actors could exploit this vulnerability by sending an influx of network commands, causing the product to generate an influx of event log traffic at a high rate. If exploited, the product would stop normal operations and self-reset creating a denial-of-service condition. The error code would need to be cleared prior to resuming normal operations.\n\n"
