In fact, it is not\ncanceled anywhere except in the restart cleanup, where we don't really\nhave to.\n\nThis can cause an init-after-queue issue: if, for example, the work was\nqueued and then drv_change_interface got executed.\n\nThis can also cause use-after-free: if the work is executed after the\nvif is freed."
