When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user."
