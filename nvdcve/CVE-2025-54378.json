In versions 11.0.13 and below of haxcms-nodejs and versions 11.0.8 and below of haxcms-php, API endpoints do not perform authorization checks when interacting with a resource. Both the JS and PHP versions of the CMS do not verify that a user has permission to interact with a resource before performing a given operation. The API endpoints within the HAX CMS application check if a user is authenticated, but don't check for authorization before performing an operation. This is fixed in versions 11.0.14 of haxcms-nodejs and 11.0.9 of haxcms-php."
