An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the bcmdhd driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-17544."
