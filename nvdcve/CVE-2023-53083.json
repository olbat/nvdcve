          "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: don't replace page in rq_pages if it's a continuation of last page\n\nThe splice read calls nfsd_splice_actor to put the pages containing file\ndata into the svc_rqst->rq_pages array. It's possible however to get a\nsplice result that only has a partial page at the end, if (e.g.) the\nfilesystem hands back a short read that doesn't cover the whole page.\n\nnfsd_splice_actor will plop the partial page into its rq_pages array and\nreturn. Then later, when nfsd_splice_actor is called again, the\nremainder of the page may end up being filled out. At this point,\nnfsd_splice_actor will put the page into the array _again_ corrupting\nthe reply. If this is done enough times, rq_next_page will overrun the\narray and corrupt the trailing fields -- the rq_respages and\nrq_next_page pointers themselves.\n\nIf we've already added the page to the array in the last pass, don't add\nit to the array a second time when dealing with a splice continuation.\nThis was originally handled properly in nfsd_splice_actor, but commit\n91e23b1c3982 (\"NFSD: Clean up nfsd_splice_actor()\") removed the check\nfor it."
