The manipulation of the argument attachmentFiles leads to unrestricted upload. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 12.0.3 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor explains, that \"this vulnerability can be exploited only on not securely installed instances, as it is adviced during product install: attachment directory should be out of web reach, so that even if executable file can be uploaded, it cannot be executed through the web.\""
