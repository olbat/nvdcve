A reference count is taken at the start\nof the process in padata_do_parallel, and released at the end in\npadata_serial_worker.\n\nThis reference count is (and only is) required for padata_replace\nto function correctly.  If padata_replace is never called then\nthere is no issue.\n\nIn the function padata_reorder which serves as the core of padata,\nas soon as padata is added to queue->serial.list, and the associated\nspin lock released, that padata may be processed and the reference\ncount on pd would go away.\n\nFix this by getting the next padata before the squeue->serial lock\nis released.\n\nIn order to make this possible, simplify padata_reorder by only\ncalling it once the next padata arrives."
