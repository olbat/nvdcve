The Fides web application allows users to edit consent and privacy notices such as cookie banners. The vulnerability makes it possible to craft a payload in the privacy policy URL which triggers JavaScript execution when the privacy notice is served by an integrated website. The domain scope of the executed JavaScript is that of the integrated website. Exploitation is limited to Admin UI users with the contributor role or higher. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. "
