The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch management CLI to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected."
