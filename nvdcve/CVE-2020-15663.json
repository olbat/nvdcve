Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with System Privileges. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2."
