      "value": "Concierge::Sessions versions from 0.8.1 before 0.8.5 for Perl generate insecure session ids. The generate_session_id function in Concierge::Sessions::Base defaults to using the uuidgen command to generate a UUID, with a fallback to using Perl's built-in rand function. Neither of these methods are secure, and attackers are able to guess session_ids that can grant them access to systems. Specifically,\n\n  *  There is no warning when uuidgen fails. The software can be quietly using the fallback rand() function with no warnings if the command fails for any reason.\n  *  The uuidgen command will generate a time-based UUID if the system does not have a high-quality random number source, because the call does not explicitly specify the --random option. Note that the system time is shared in HTTP responses.\n  *  UUIDs are identifiers whose mere possession grants access, as per RFC 9562.\n  *  The output of the built-in rand() function is predictable and unsuitable for security applications."
