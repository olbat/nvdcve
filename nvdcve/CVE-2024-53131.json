In the current\nimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the function\nreturns to the caller.\n\nHere, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer\nhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the\ncaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it\nwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call\ntouch_buffer() here in the first place.\n\nSo this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself."
