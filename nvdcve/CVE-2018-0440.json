The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of user input within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and then sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. A successful exploit could allow the authenticated attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user."
