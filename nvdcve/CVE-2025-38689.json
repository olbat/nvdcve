      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Fix NULL dereference in avx512_status()\n\nProblem\n-------\nWith CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU enabled, reading /proc/[kthread]/arch_status\ncauses a warning and a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis is because the AVX-512 timestamp code uses x86_task_fpu() but\ndoesn't check it for NULL. CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU addles that function\nfor kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.\n\nThe point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access\ntask->fpu after going through kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all\nkernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task->fpu.\n\nSolution\n--------\nOne option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from\nx86_task_fpu(). However, that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a\ndefense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel threads.\n\nInstead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads\naltogether. The data was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is\nonly updated for user threads, not kernel threads.\n\nIf anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come\nback later and do it properly, separate from this bug fix.\n\n[ dhansen: mostly rewrite changelog ]"
