An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv2 packet to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco Secure Client Software to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on the client software.\r\n\r Note: Cisco Secure Client Software releases 4.10 and earlier were known as Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client."
