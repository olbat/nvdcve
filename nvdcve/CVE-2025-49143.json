Prior to v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 , files uploaded by users to Nautobot's MEDIA_ROOT directory, including DeviceType image attachments as well as images attached to a Location, Device, or Rack, are served to users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication. As a consequence, such files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can guess the correct URL for a given file. Nautobot v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 address this issue by adding enforcement of Nautobot user authentication to this endpoint."
