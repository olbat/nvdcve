The vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization. An attacker who has valid administrative access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device, which could lead to complete system compromise."
