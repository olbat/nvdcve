      "value": "Alloy Core libraries at the root of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Prior to 0.8.26 and 1.4.1, an uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via eip712_signing_hash(). Software with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible. The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version v1.4.1 and backported to v0.8.26."
