The integrated web server could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to modify particular parts of the device configuration via SNMP. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system. Successful exploitation requires system privileges and user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentiality and the integrity of the affected system. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known."
