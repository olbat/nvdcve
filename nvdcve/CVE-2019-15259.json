The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, access sensitive browser-based information, and similar exploits."
