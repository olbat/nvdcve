The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly validates user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database, impacting the confidentiality of the system."
