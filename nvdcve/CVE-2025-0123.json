          "value": "A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables unlicensed administrators to view clear-text data captured using the  packet capture feature https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/take-packet-captures/take-a-custom-packet-capture  in decrypted HTTP/2 data streams traversing network interfaces on the firewall. HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.\n\nIn normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .\n\nThe administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .\n\nCustomer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.\n\nPrisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability."
