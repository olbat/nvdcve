Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds."
