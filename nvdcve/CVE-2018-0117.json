          "value": "A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of the Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of user-supplied data by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to the internal distributed instance (DI) network address on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unhandled error condition on the affected system, which would cause the CF instances to reload and consequently cause the entire VPC to reload, resulting in the disconnection of all subscribers and a DoS condition on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software N4.0 through N5.5 with the Cisco StarOS operating system 19.2 through 21.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve17656."
