The Reset Code is used to reset the User PIN, but it is disabled by default. A flaw in the implementation of OpenPGP sets the Reset Code to a known value upon initialization. If the retry counter for the Reset Code is set to non-zero without changing the Reset Code, this known value can be used to reset the User PIN. To set the retry counters, the Admin PIN is required."
