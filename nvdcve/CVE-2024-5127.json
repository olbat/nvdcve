This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data."
