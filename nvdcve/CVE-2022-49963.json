With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly\n    copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the\n    GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).\n\nSo it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our\nCHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.\n\nTestcase: igt@gem_lmem_swapping\n(cherry picked from commit 8676145eb2f53a9940ff70910caf0125bd8a4bc2)"
