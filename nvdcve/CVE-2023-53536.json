      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-crypto: make blk_crypto_evict_key() more robust\n\nIf blk_crypto_evict_key() sees that the key is still in-use (due to a\nbug) or that ->keyslot_evict failed, it currently just returns while\nleaving the key linked into the keyslot management structures.\n\nHowever, blk_crypto_evict_key() is only called in contexts such as inode\neviction where failure is not an option.  So actually the caller\nproceeds with freeing the blk_crypto_key regardless of the return value\nof blk_crypto_evict_key().\n\nThese two assumptions don't match, and the result is that there can be a\nuse-after-free in blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys() after one of these\nerrors occurs.  (Note, these errors *shouldn't* happen; we're just\ntalking about what happens if they do anyway.)\n\nFix this by making blk_crypto_evict_key() unlink the key from the\nkeyslot management structures even on failure.\n\nAlso improve some comments."
