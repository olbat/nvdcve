A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release\nbuild.  This is CVE-2025-58144.\n\nAnd then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually\nobtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can\nnot only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing\ndomain boundaries to be violated.  This is CVE-2025-58145."
