The API for deleting an organization custom profile field is supposed to be restricted to organization administrators, but its handler failed to check that the field belongs to the same organization as the user. Therefore, an administrator of any organization was incorrectly allowed to delete custom profile fields belonging to a different organization. This is fixed in Zulip Server 10.1."
