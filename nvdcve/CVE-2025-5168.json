Affected by this issue is the function MDLImporter::ImportUVCoordinate_3DGS_MDL345 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation of the argument iIndex leads to out-of-bounds read. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future."
