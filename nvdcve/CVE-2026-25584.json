Prior to version 2.3.1.3, there is a stack-buffer-overflow vulnerability in CIccTagFloatNum<>::GetValues(). This is triggered when processing a malformed ICC profile. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds write on the stack, potentially leading to memory corruption, information disclosure, or code execution when processing specially crafted ICC files. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.3."
