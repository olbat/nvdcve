The subsequent doorbell\nring likely is unnecessary too, but it's harmless. Leave it alone.\n\nThis is probably Bug 219532, but no confirmation has been received.\n\nThe issue has been independently reproduced and confirmed fixed using\na USB MCU programmed to NAK the Status stage of SET_ADDRESS forever.\nEverything continued working normally after several prevented crashes."
