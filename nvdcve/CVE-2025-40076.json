Using msi->domain->parent as an\nargument for generic_handle_domain_irq() leads to below error:\n\n\t\"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address\"\n\nThis error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host\ncontroller driver to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a\nsimilar pattern to handle MSIs (see link section)), but it was not tested\non hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver due to lack of\nhardware.\n\n[mani: reworded subject and description]"
