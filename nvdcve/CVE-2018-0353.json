          "value": "A vulnerability in traffic-monitoring functions in Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to circumvent Layer 4 Traffic Monitor (L4TM) functionality and bypass security protections. The vulnerability is due to a change in the underlying operating system software that is responsible for monitoring affected traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to pass traffic through the device, which the WSA was configured to deny. This vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS versions for WSA on both virtual and hardware appliances running any release of the 10.5.1, 10.5.2, or 11.0.0 WSA Software. The WSA is vulnerable if it is configured for L4TM. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg78875."
