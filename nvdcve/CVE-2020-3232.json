The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of data that is returned for Cisco Discovery Protocol queries to SNMP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request for Cisco Discovery Protocol information by using SNMP. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
