Execution of the script as root can lead to privilege escalation, potentially providing the adversary complete control of the system.\n\nThis issue only affects specific line cards, such as the MPC10, MPC11, LC4800, LC9600, MX304-LMIC16, SRX4700, and EX9200-15C.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1, \n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions prior to 23.1R2."
