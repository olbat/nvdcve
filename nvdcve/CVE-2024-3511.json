Due to flawed authorization logic, a malicious actor with access to the management console can exploit a specific bypass method to retrieve versioned files without proper authorization.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized disclosure of configuration or resource files that may be stored as registry versions, potentially aiding further attacks or system reconnaissance."
