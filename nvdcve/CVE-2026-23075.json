In the complete callback\nesd_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In\nesd_usb_close() the URBs are freed by calling\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in esd_usb_close().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\nesd_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor."
