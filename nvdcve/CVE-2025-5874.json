This issue affects the function run_query of the file /query_runner/python.py of the component getattr Handler. The manipulation leads to sandbox issue. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor explains, that \"[t]he Python data source is disabled by default and is clearly marked in our documentation as discouraged due to its security implications. Users who choose to enable it are doing so at their own risk, with full awareness that it bypasses standard safeguards.\""
