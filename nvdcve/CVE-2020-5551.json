The affected DCUs are installed in Lexus (LC, LS, NX, RC, RC F), TOYOTA CAMRY, and TOYOTA SIENNA manufactured in the regions other than Japan from Oct. 2016 to Oct. 2019. An attacker with certain knowledge on the target vehicle control system may be able to send some diagnostic commands to ECUs with some limited availability impacts; the vendor states critical vehicle controls such as driving, turning, and stopping are not affected."
