      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()\n\nsyzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work\nat mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from\nmgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can\nrace with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from\nhci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().\n\nSince mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can\nsafely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and\nhci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag\nafter INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.\n\nThis is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization\nvia hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere\nelse. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future\npatch."
