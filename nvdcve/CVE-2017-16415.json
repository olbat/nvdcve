The vulnerability is caused by a computation that writes data past the end of the intended buffer; the computation is a part of the functionality that handles font encodings. The vulnerability is a result of out of range pointer offset that is used to access sub-elements of an internal data structure. An attacker can potentially leverage the vulnerability to corrupt sensitive data or execute arbitrary code."
