Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of HNAP login requests. The issue results from the lack of proper handling of empty passwords. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the router. Was ZDI-CAN-9471."
