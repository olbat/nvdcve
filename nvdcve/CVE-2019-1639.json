The vulnerability exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system."
