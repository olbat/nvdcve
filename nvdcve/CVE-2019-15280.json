The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in certain sections of the interface that are visible to other users. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability."
