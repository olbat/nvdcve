The vulnerability exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuading the user to open the file by using the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system."
