As a result, a user who does not have access to those symlinks outside of the Docker container would now have access via the local workspace.\n\nUsers should upgrade to version 1.134.0 and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. After upgrading, users must re-build their applications using the sam build --use-container to update the symlinks."
