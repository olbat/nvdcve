An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device using IPv4 or IPv6. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3) and requires a valid SNMP community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials."
