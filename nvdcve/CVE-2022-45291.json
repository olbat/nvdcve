Attacks can use the PWS_printfile.php, PWS_frame_text.php, PWS_listfile.php, PWS_winter.php, and PWS_easyweathersetup.php endpoints. A contributing factor is a hardcoded login password of support, which is not documented. (This is not the same as the documented setup password, which is 12345.) The issue was fixed in late 2022."
