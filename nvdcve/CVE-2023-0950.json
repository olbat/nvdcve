In the affected versions of LibreOffice certain malformed spreadsheet formulas, such as AGGREGATE, could be created with less parameters passed to the formula interpreter than it expected, leading to an array index underflow, in which case there is a risk that arbitrary code could be executed. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.6; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.1."
