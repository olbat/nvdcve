      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t\n\nThe 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but\nlacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh\nstructure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.\n\nFor example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operation\nvia rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is\nstill active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.\n\nThis patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and\nupdates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which\noperate reference counts atomically."
