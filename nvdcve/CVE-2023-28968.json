An example session can be seen by running the following command and evaluating the output. user@device# run show security flow session source-prefix <address/mask> extensive Session ID: <session ID>, Status: Normal, State: Active Policy name: <name of policy> Dynamic application: junos:UNKNOWN, <<<<< LOOK HERE Please note, the JDPI-Decoder and the AppID SigPack are both affected and both must be upgraded along with the operating system to address the matter. By default, none of this is auto-enabled for automatic updates.
