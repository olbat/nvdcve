          "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()\n\nOn some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual\nCPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with\naccess to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the\nring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the\nCPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.\n\nWith the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the\nfile, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the\nbuffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to\nwake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nWhile debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is\nOK to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is\nnot fine, and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in\nis within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).\n\n\nBugzilla: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204705"
