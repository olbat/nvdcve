The connection attempt must initiate from a Webex mobile application for either iOS or Android. The vulnerability is due to unintended meeting information exposure in a specific meeting join flow for mobile applications. An unauthorized attendee could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a known meeting ID or meeting URL from the mobile device&rsquo;s web browser. The browser will then request to launch the device&rsquo;s Webex mobile application. A successful exploit could allow the unauthorized attendee to join the password-protected meeting. The unauthorized attendee will be visible in the attendee list of the meeting as a mobile attendee. Cisco has applied updates that address this vulnerability and no user action is required. This vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites releases earlier than 39.11.5 and 40.1.3."
