As a result\nice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but\nice_devlink_reinit_up() still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control\nqueues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails with -EBUSY.\n\nAdd ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with\nice_init_hw() in ice_devlink_reinit_up()."
