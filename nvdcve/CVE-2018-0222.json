The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, static user credentials for the default administrative account for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco DNA Center Software prior to Release 1.1.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh98929."
