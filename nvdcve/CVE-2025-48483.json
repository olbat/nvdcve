Prior to version 1.8.180, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data during mail signature sanitization. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities. Additionally, if an administrator accesses one of these emails with a modified signature, it could result in a subsequent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180."
