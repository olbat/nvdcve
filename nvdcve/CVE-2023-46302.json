          "value": "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .\n\nApache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to\nhandle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines\na YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming\nYAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method\nis invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.\n \nWe have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.\nThis issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.Â Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.\nIf using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.\n\n"
