Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the MiniDLNA service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the MiniDLNA service. Was ZDI-CAN-19910."
