      "value": "The Modula Image Gallery – Photo Grid & Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.6. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to modify specific posts before updating them via the REST API. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to update the title, excerpt, and content of arbitrary posts by passing post IDs in the modulaImages field when editing a gallery."
