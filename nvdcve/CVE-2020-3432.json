An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a target file on a specific path. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, the exploit could lead to a denial of service condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the system."
