      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: i2c-hid: fix potential buffer overflow in i2c_hid_get_report()\n\n`i2c_hid_xfer` is used to read `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` bytes of data\ninto `ihid->rawbuf`.\n\nThe former can come from the userspace in the hidraw driver and is only\nbounded by HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE(16384) by default (unless we also set\n`max_buffer_size` field of `struct hid_ll_driver` which we do not).\n\nThe latter has size determined at runtime by the maximum size of\ndifferent report types you could receive on any particular device and\ncan be a much smaller value.\n\nFix this by truncating `recv_len` to `ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`.\n\nThe impact is low since access to hidraw devices requires root."
