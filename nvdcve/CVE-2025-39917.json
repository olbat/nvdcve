      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt\n\nStanislav reported that in bpf_crypto_crypt() the destination dynptr's\nsize is not validated to be at least as large as the source dynptr's\nsize before calling into the crypto backend with 'len = src_len'. This\ncan result in an OOB write when the destination is smaller than the\nsource.\n\nConcretely, in mentioned function, psrc and pdst are both linear\nbuffers fetched from each dynptr:\n\n  psrc = __bpf_dynptr_data(src, src_len);\n  [...]\n  pdst = __bpf_dynptr_data_rw(dst, dst_len);\n  [...]\n  err = decrypt ?\n        ctx->type->decrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv) :\n        ctx->type->encrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv);\n\nThe crypto backend expects pdst to be large enough with a src_len length\nthat can be written. Add an additional src_len > dst_len check and bail\nout if it's the case. Note that these kfuncs are accessible under root\nprivileges only."
