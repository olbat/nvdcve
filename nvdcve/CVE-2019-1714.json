The vulnerability is due to improper credential management when using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or basic authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a VPN session to an affected device after another VPN user has successfully authenticated to the affected device via SAML SSO. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to secured networks behind the affected device."
