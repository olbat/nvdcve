The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store an XSS attack within the interface. This stored XSS attack would then be executed on the system of any user viewing the attacker-supplied data element."
