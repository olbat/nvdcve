This access code is intended to prevent unauthorized changes to OTP configurations. The access code is not checked when updating NFC specific components of the OTP configurations. This may allow an attacker to access configured OTPs and passwords stored in slots that were not configured by the user to be read over NFC, despite a user having set an access code. (Users who have not set an access code, or who have not configured the OTP slots, are not impacted by this issue.)"
