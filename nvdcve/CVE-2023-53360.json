      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)\n\nI found that the read code might send multiple requests using the same\nnfs_pgio_header, but nfs4_proc_read_setup() is only called once. This is\nhow we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but also\nmeans we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratch\nbuffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copy\nsomething to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUS\nhole segments.\n\nI fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. I\nprovide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies,\nand free the scratch buffer when the nfs_pgio_header is freed."
