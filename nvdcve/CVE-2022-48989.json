Once the cookie is withdrawn the object is removed\nthe below oops will occur because the object associated with the cookie\nis now NULL.\n\nFix the oops by clearing the LRU_DISCARD bit if another thread uses the\ncookie before the cookie_worker runs.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n  ...\n  CPU: 31 PID: 44773 Comm: kworker/u130:1 Tainted: G     E    6.0.0-5.dneg.x86_64 #1\n  Hardware name: Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/26/2022\n  Workqueue: events_unbound netfs_rreq_write_to_cache_work [netfs]\n  RIP: 0010:cachefiles_prepare_write+0x28/0x90 [cachefiles]\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n    netfs_rreq_write_to_cache_work+0x11c/0x320 [netfs]\n    process_one_work+0x217/0x3e0\n    worker_thread+0x4a/0x3b0\n    kthread+0xd6/0x100"
