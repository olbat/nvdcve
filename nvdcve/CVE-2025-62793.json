Because SVG supports active content, an attacker could upload a crafted SVG that executes script when viewed, resulting in stored XSS under the application origin. A victim who opens the SVG URL or any page embedding it could have their session hijacked, data exfiltrated, or actions performed on their behalf. This vulnerability is fixed n 5.3.0."
