          "value": "tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0."
