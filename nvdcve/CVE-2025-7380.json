These scripts are not properly sanitized and will be executed when the folder name is subsequently displayed in the user interface. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user's session, potentially accessing session cookies or other sensitive data.\nAffected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 to ADM 4.3.3.RH61 as well as ADM 5.0.0.RIN1 and earlier."
