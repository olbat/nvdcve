An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Modbus traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to hang, causing traffic inspection to stop.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
