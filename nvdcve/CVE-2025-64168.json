From 2.0.0 to before 2.2.2, under high concurrency, when session_state is passed to Agent or Team during run or arun calls, a race condition can occur, causing a session_state to be assigned and persisted to the incorrect session. This may result in user data from one session being exposed to another user. This has been patched in version 2.2.2."
