There are multiple externally accessible pages that do not require any sort of authentication, and store system information for internal usage. The devices automatically query these pages to update dashboards and other statistics, but the pages can be accessed externally without any authentication. All the pages follow the naming convention live_(string).shtml. Among the information disclosed is: interface status logs, IP address of the device, MAC address of the device, model and current firmware version, location, all running processes, all interfaces and their statuses, all current DHCP leases and the associated hostnames, all other wireless networks in range of the router, memory statistics, and components of the configuration of the device such as enabled features."
