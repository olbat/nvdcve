To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be logged in as a low-level administrator. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL request to gain privileged access in the context of the affected page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges in the Webex Recording Admin page, which could allow them to view or delete recordings that they would not normally be able to access."
