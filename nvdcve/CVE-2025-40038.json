      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid\n\nSkip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP\nisn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must\ndecode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the\nnext RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading\nguest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.\ncan sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs\ndisabled.\n\n BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at ./include/linux/uaccess.h:106\n in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 32611, name: qemu\n preempt_count: 1, expected: 0\n INFO: lockdep is turned off.\n irq event stamp: 30580\n hardirqs last  enabled at (30579): [<ffffffffc08b2527>] vcpu_run+0x1787/0x1db0 [kvm]\n hardirqs last disabled at (30580): [<ffffffffb4f62e32>] __schedule+0x1e2/0xed0\n softirqs last  enabled at (30570): [<ffffffffb4247a64>] fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate+0x44/0x210\n softirqs last disabled at (30568): [<ffffffffb4247a64>] fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate+0x44/0x210\n CPU: 298 UID: 0 PID: 32611 Comm: qemu Tainted: G     U              6.16.0-smp--e6c618b51cfe-sleep #782 NONE\n Tainted: [U]=USER\n Hardware name: Google Astoria-Turin/astoria, BIOS 0.20241223.2-0 01/17/2025\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x7d/0xb0\n  __might_resched+0x271/0x290\n  __might_fault+0x28/0x80\n  kvm_vcpu_read_guest_page+0x8d/0xc0 [kvm]\n  kvm_fetch_guest_virt+0x92/0xc0 [kvm]\n  __do_insn_fetch_bytes+0xf3/0x1e0 [kvm]\n  x86_decode_insn+0xd1/0x1010 [kvm]\n  x86_emulate_instruction+0x105/0x810 [kvm]\n  __svm_skip_emulated_instruction+0xc4/0x140 [kvm_amd]\n  handle_fastpath_invd+0xc4/0x1a0 [kvm]\n  vcpu_run+0x11a1/0x1db0 [kvm]\n  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x5cc/0x730 [kvm]\n  kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x578/0x6a0 [kvm]\n  __se_sys_ioctl+0x6d/0xb0\n  do_syscall_64+0x8a/0x2c0\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n RIP: 0033:0x7f479d57a94b\n  </TASK>\n\nNote, this is essentially a reapply of commit 5c30e8101e8d (\"KVM: SVM:\nSkip WRMSR fastpath on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid\"), but with\ndifferent justification (KVM now grabs SRCU when skipping the instruction\nfor other reasons)."
