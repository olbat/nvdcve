      "value": "Docker Desktop for Windows contains multiple incorrect permission assignment vulnerabilities in the installer's handling of the C:\\ProgramData\\DockerDesktop directory. The installer creates this directory without proper ownership verification, creating two exploitation scenarios:\n\nScenario 1 (Persistent Attack):\nIf a low-privileged attacker pre-creates C:\\ProgramData\\DockerDesktop before Docker Desktop installation, the attacker retains ownership of the directory even after the installer applies restrictive ACLs. At any time after installation completes, the attacker can modify the directory ACL (as the owner) and tamper with critical configuration files such as install-settings.json to specify a malicious credentialHelper, causing arbitrary code execution when any user runs Docker Desktop.\n\nScenario 2 (TOCTOU Attack):\nDuring installation, there is a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition between when the installer creates C:\\ProgramData\\DockerDesktop and when it sets secure ACLs. A low-privileged attacker actively monitoring for the installation can inject malicious files (such as install-settings.json) with attacker-controlled ACLs during this window, achieving the same code execution outcome."
