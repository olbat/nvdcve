That task may exit early via a signal and its task_struct\nwill be released.\nA pending vhost_task_wake() will then attempt to wake the task and\naccess a task_struct which is no longer there.\n\nAcquire a reference on the task_struct while creating the thread and\nrelease the reference while the struct vhost_task itself is removed.\nIf the task exits early due to a signal, then the vhost_task_wake() will\nstill access a valid task_struct. The wake is safe and will be skipped\nin this case."
