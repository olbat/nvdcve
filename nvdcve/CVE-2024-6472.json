When a document with a signed\n macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro \nis executed.\n\nPreviously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.\n\n\nThis issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5."
