This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the VPN from an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and access the IPSec VPN network. The attacker may obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user, depending on the crafted credentials that are used. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability."
