The vulnerability is due to a memory exhaustion condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted TCP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust device resources, resulting in a DoS condition for traffic transiting the affected device."
