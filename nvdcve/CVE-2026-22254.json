      "value": "Winter is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) based on the Laravel PHP framework. Versions of Winter CMS before 1.2.10 allow users with access to the CMS Asset Manager were able to upload SVGs without automatic sanitization. To actively exploit this security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a user account with the following permission: cms.manage_assets. The Winter CMS maintainers strongly recommend that the cms.manage_assets permission only be reserved to trusted administrators and developers in general. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.10."
