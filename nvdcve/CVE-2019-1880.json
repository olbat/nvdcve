The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the firmware image file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing the BIOS upgrade utility with a specific set of options. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the firmware signature-verification process and install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device."
