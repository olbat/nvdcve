The CSV datasource plugin is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing CSV data from a remote endpoint configured by an administrator. If this plugin was configured to send requests to a bare host with no path (e.g.  https://www.example.com/ https://www.example.com/` ), requests to an endpoint other than the one configured by the administrator could be triggered by a specially crafted request from any user, resulting in an SSRF vector.
