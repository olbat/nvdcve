The vulnerability is due to a failure to enforce access restrictions on the Help Desk and User Provisioning roles that are assigned to authenticated users. This failure could allow an authenticated attacker to modify critical attributes of higher-privileged accounts on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Releases 12.1 and prior. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd61779."
