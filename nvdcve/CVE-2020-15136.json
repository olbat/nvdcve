When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality."
