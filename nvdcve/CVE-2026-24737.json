      "value": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.1.0, user control of properties and methods of the Acroform module allows users to inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized input to one of the following methods or properties, a user can inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions, which are executed when the victim opens the document. The vulnerable API members are AcroformChoiceField.addOption, AcroformChoiceField.setOptions, AcroFormCheckBox.appearanceState, and AcroFormRadioButton.appearanceState. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.1.0."
