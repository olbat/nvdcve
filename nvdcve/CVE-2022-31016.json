Argo CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade."
