The default limit was defined back in\n2018 and while good enough back then, we are generally seeing far more BPF\nconsumers today.\n\nAdjust the limit for the BPF JIT pool from originally 1/4 to now 1/2 of the\nmodule memory space to better reflect today's needs and avoid more users\nrunning into potentially hard to debug issues."
