          "value": "Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. Prior to 2.5.1, traceroute responses from the remote node are not rate limited. Given that there are SNR measurements attributed to each received transmission, this is a guaranteed way to get a remote station to reliably and continuously respond. You could easily get 100 samples in a short amount of time (estimated 2 minutes), whereas passively doing the same could take hours or days. There are secondary effects that non-ratelimited traceroute does also allow a 2:1 reflected DoS of the network as well, but these concerns are less than the problem with positional confidentiality (other DoS routes exist). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1."
