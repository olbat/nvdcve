      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()\n\nAbove the while() loop in wait_sb_inodes(), we document that we must wait\nfor all pages under writeback for data integrity.  Consequently, if a\nmapping, like fuse, traditionally does not have data integrity semantics,\nthere is no need to wait at all; we can simply skip these inodes.\n\nThis restores fuse back to prior behavior where syncs are no-ops.  This\nfixes a user regression where if a system is running a faulty fuse server\nthat does not reply to issued write requests, this causes wait_sb_inodes()\nto wait forever."
