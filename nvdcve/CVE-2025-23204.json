Starting in version 3.3.8, a security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced by another one as there's no break in a clause. As this falls back to `security`, the impact is there only when there's only a security after resolver and none inside security. Version 3.3.15 contains a patch for the issue."
