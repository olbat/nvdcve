An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted archive file, which should be blocked, through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the anti-malware scanner and download malware onto an end user workstation. The downloaded malware will not automatically execute unless the end user extracts and launches the malicious file.&nbsp;"
