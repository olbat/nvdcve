Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF)."
