          "value": "The Windows service configuration of ABP and AES contains an unquoted ImagePath registry value vulnerability. This allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious executable in a predictable location such as C:\\Program.exe. If the service runs with elevated privileges, exploitation results in privilege escalation to SYSTEM level. This vulnerability arises from an unquoted service path affecting systems where the executable resides in a path containing spaces.\nAffected products and versions include: ABP 2.0.7.6130 and earlier as well as AES 1.0.6.6133 and earlier."
