The vulnerability exists because the affected software allows users to access resources that are intended for administrators only. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to add, delete, and edit certain network configurations in the same manner as a user with administrative privileges."
