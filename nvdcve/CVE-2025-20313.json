A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r Because this allows the attacker to bypass a major security feature of the device, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium to High.\r\n\r For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r   \r\n\r  \r\n\r  \r\n\r ERP"
