This vulnerability primarily affects the command processing or system call components in ROS, making them susceptible to manipulation by malicious entities. Through this, unauthorized commands can be executed, leading to remote code execution (RCE), data theft, and malicious activities. The affected components include External Command Execution Modules, System Call Handlers, and Interface Scripts. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
