          "value": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device unexpectedly reloading. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly. The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network. The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable. This vulnerability affects Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve79599, CSCve87784, CSCve91371, CSCve91387."
