From versions 1.4.8 to 1.5.0, there is a one-click remote code execution vulnerability through the custom URL handling. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website or embedding a specially crafted URL on any website. If a victim clicks the exploit link in their browser, the app’s custom URL handler is triggered, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.1."
