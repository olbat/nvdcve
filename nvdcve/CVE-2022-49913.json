Since they\nwere not yet added to the refs ulist and prelim_release() does not free\nthe lists, on error the caller can only free the lists attached to the\nrefs that were added to the refs ulist, all the remaining refs get their\ninode lists never freed, therefore leaking their memory.\n\nFix this by having prelim_release() always free any attached inode list\nto each ref found in the rbtree, and have find_parent_nodes() set the\nref's inode list to NULL once it transfers ownership of the inode list\nto a ref added to the refs ulist passed to find_parent_nodes()."
