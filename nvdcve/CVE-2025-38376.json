Then if udc driver\naccess registers after that point, the system will hang.\n\nThe correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect device from host when\nthe USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect\nevent and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device\nwork after system resume, this will reconnect device automatically.\n\nTo make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already at suspend state, this will\nkeep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled wakeup\ncapability."
