The encrypted metadata block with a TX value lacks a checksum, allowing bitflipping to amplify a contamination attack. This can cause metadata deanonymization and risk-score inflation. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"We do not believe that TX power authentication would be a useful defense against relay attacks.\""
