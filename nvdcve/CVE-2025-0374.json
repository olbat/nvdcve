This version does not preserve the mode of the input file, and is world-readable.  This applies to files that would normally have restricted visibility, such as /etc/master.passwd.\n\nAn unprivileged local user may be able to read encrypted root and user passwords from the temporary master.passwd file created in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.  This is possible only when conflicts within the password file arise during an update, and the unprotected file is deleted when conflicts are resolved."
