Install scripts defined in server templates execute directly on the host operating system as root via bash -c, with no sandboxing or containerization. Any user with template.create or template.update permission can define arbitrary shell commands that achieve full root-level remote code execution on every node machine in the cluster. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 11980aaf3f46315b02777f325ba02c56b110165d."
