If that happens, the runtime PM resume callback\npvr_power_device_resume() is not called, the GPU clocks are not\nre-enabled, and the kernel crashes on the next attempt to access GPU\nregisters as part of the power-on sequence.\n\nReplace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and\npm_runtime_force_resume() with direct calls to the driver's runtime PM\ncallbacks, pvr_power_device_suspend() and pvr_power_device_resume(),\nto ensure clocks are re-enabled and avoid the kernel crash."
