Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the telematics functionality, which operates over HTTPS. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the certificate presented by the server. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root."
