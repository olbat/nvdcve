      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: don't check PageError in __extent_writepage\n\n__extent_writepage currenly sets PageError whenever any error happens,\nand the also checks for PageError to decide if to call error handling.\nThis leads to very unclear responsibility for cleaning up on errors.\nIn the VM and generic writeback helpers the basic idea is that once\nI/O is fired off all error handling responsibility is delegated to the\nend I/O handler.  But if that end I/O handler sets the PageError bit,\nand the submitter checks it, the bit could in some cases leak into the\nsubmission context for fast enough I/O.\n\nFix this by simply not checking PageError and just using the local\nret variable to check for submission errors.  This also fundamentally\nsolves the long problem documented in a comment in __extent_writepage\nby never leaking the error bit into the submission context."
