In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue."
