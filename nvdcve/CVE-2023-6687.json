Depending on the nature of the event that Elastic Agent attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the Elastic Agent logs. Elastic has released 8.11.3 and 7.17.16 that prevents this issue by limiting these types of logs to DEBUG level logging, which is disabled by default."
