Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck` which passes unfiltered input to the `explain_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed through the `oracle.py` `execute_check` method and to the `explain_check` method for execution. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-103`."
