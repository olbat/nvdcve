      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: codec: sma1307: Fix memory corruption in sma1307_setting_loaded()\n\nThe sma1307->set.header_size is how many integers are in the header\n(there are 8 of them) but instead of allocating space of 8 integers\nwe allocate 8 bytes.  This leads to memory corruption when we copy data\nit on the next line:\n\n        memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data,\n               sma1307->set.header_size * sizeof(int));\n\nAlso since we're immediately copying over the memory in ->set.header,\nthere is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array()\nto allocate the memory instead."
