      "value": "OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to 4.1.10, the application contains path traversal vulnerability in multiple file operation handlers in server/handles/fsmanage.go. Filename components in req.Names are directly concatenated with validated directories using stdpath.Join. This allows \"..\" sequences to bypass path restrictions, enabling users to access other users' files within the same storage mount and perform unauthorized actions such as deletion, renaming, or copying of files. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level authorisation by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised file removal and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10."
