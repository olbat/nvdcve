If driver_override_show() reads\ncdx_dev->driver_override without locking, it could potentially access\na freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string\nconcurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address, which is a\nsecurity risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.\n\nAdditionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well\nas many other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show\nfunction, and it has been working without issues.\n\nThis potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis\ntool, which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify\ndata races and atomicity violations."
