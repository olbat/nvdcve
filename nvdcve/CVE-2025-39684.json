      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()\n\nsyzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The\nproblem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return\ndata to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is\nan information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at\nthe time of writing.\n\nOne culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have\na specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`\nhandler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.  It\nnever returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.\n\nFix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure\nthat uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before\nhandling each instruction.\n\nThanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix\nreplaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not\nalways necessary to clear the whole buffer."
