There are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be stored unencrypted in a database.  Users should ensure they set the encryption setting correctly.  This vulnerability is patched in 4.2.0."
