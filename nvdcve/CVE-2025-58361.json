      "value": "Promptcraft Forge Studio is a toolkit for evaluating, optimizing, and maintaining  LLM-powered applications. All versions contain an non-exhaustive URL scheme check that does not protect against XSS. User-controlled URLs pass through src/utils/validation.ts, but the check only strips `javascript:` and a few patterns. `data:` URLs (for example data:image/svg+xml,â€¦) still pass. If a sanitized value is used in href/src, an attacker can execute a script. There is currently no fix for this issue."
