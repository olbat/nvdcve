          "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series. Cisco IP Conference Phone 8831 is not affected."
