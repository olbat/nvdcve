An attacker with access to either the local system logs or a centralized logging store may have access to other users accounts. This issue has been addressed in version 6.4.18.1. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version. Users unable to upgrade may remove from all users the log module ACL rights or disable logging."
