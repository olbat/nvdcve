Add these missing checks.\n\nIf we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the\nexisting BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than\nthe BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read\npast the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow\nthe host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.\n\nWhile at it, add comments which clarifies the support for dynamically\nchanging the physical address of a BAR. (Which was also missing.)"
