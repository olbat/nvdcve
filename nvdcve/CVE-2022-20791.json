This vulnerability is due to insufficient file permission restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command from the API to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability."
