      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/futex: ensure io_futex_wait() cleans up properly on failure\n\nThe io_futex_data is allocated upfront and assigned to the io_kiocb\nasync_data field, but the request isn't marked with REQ_F_ASYNC_DATA\nat that point. Those two should always go together, as the flag tells\nio_uring whether the field is valid or not.\n\nAdditionally, on failure cleanup, the futex handler frees the data but\ndoes not clear ->async_data. Clear the data and the flag in the error\npath as well.\n\nThanks to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and particularly ReDress for\nreporting this."
