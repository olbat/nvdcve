Prior to version 3.47.1, the travis_encrypt_binstar_token implementation in the conda-smithy package has been identified as vulnerable to an Oracle Padding Attack. This vulnerability results from the use of an outdated and insecure padding scheme during RSA encryption. A malicious actor with access to an oracle system can exploit this flaw by iteratively submitting modified ciphertexts and analyzing responses to infer the plaintext without possessing the private key. This issue has been patched in version 3.47.1."
