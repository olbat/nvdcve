The vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a CRLF injection attack, adding arbitrary HTTP headers in the responses of the system and redirecting the user to arbitrary websites."
