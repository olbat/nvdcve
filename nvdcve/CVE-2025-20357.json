      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Cyber Vision Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials that allow access to the Reports page. By default, all pre-defined users have this access, as do any custom users that are configured to allow access to the Reports page."
