Successful exploitation of this flaw allows an attacker to have complete and unrestricted access to the database, with a web user with minimal permissions. This may involve obtaining user information, such as emails, password hashes, etc. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to contact the developer and to coordinate an update schedule."
