Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the NetUSB.ko kernel module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15773."
