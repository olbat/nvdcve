      "value": "NanoMQ MQTT Broker (NanoMQ) is an all-around Edge Messaging Platform. In version 0.24.6, NanoMQ has a protocol parsing / forwarding inconsistency when handling shared subscriptions ($share/). A malformed SUBSCRIBE topic such as $share/ab (missing the second /) is not strictly validated during the subscription stage, so the invalid Topic Filter is stored into the subscription table. Later, when any PUBLISH matches this subscription, the broker send path (nmq_pipe_send_start_v4/v5) performs a second $share/ parsing using strchr() and increments the returned pointer without NULL checks. If the second strchr() returns NULL, sub_topic++ turns the pointer into an invalid address (e.g. 0x1). This invalid pointer is then passed into topic_filtern(), which triggers strlen() and crashes with SIGSEGV. The crash is stable and remotely triggerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.24.7."
