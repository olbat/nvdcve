The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the size or total amount of resources allowed via the web interface. An attacker who has valid credentials for the application could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted or malformed HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause oversubscription of system resources or cause a component to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition."
