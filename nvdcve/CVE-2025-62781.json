      "value": "PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. Prior to 4.8.0, users with a local account can change their password while logged in. When doing so, all other active sessions are terminated, except for the currently active one. However, the current sessionâ€™s token remains valid and is not refreshed. If an attacker has previously obtained this session token through another vulnerability, changing the password will not invalidate their access. As a result, the attacker can continue to act as the user even after the password has been changed. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.8.0."
