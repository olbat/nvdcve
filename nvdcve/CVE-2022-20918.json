          "value": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) access controls for Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module, Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, and Cisco Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform an SNMP GET request using a default credential. This vulnerability is due to the presence of a default credential for SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 GET request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device using the default credential. This attack will only be successful if SNMP is configured, and the attacker can only perform SNMP GET requests; write access using SNMP is not allowed."
