          "value": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. In Cacti 1.2.24, users with console access can be redirected to an arbitrary website after a change password performed via a specifically crafted URL. The `auth_changepassword.php` file accepts `ref` as a URL parameter and reflects it in the form used to perform the change password. It's value is used to perform a redirect via `header` PHP function. A user can be tricked in performing the change password operation, e.g., via a phishing message, and then interacting with the malicious website where the redirection has been performed, e.g., downloading malwares, providing credentials, etc. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
