      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: usb_8dev: usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\n\nFix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a (\"can: gs_usb:\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\").\n\nIn usb_8dev_open() -> usb_8dev_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are\nallocated, added to the priv->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the\ncomplete callback usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and\nresubmitted. In usb_8dev_close() -> unlink_all_urbs() the URBs are freed by\ncalling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&priv->rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\nusb_8dev_read_bulk_callback() to the priv->rx_submitted anchor."
