The vulnerability is due to the improper input validation of tar packages uploaded through the Web Portal to the Image Repository. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted tar package and viewing the log entries that are generated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying OS."
