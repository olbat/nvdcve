This may\ncause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged because\nemit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the size\ncalculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-based\nKASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened to\nbe all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem by\nassuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the size\nof the bpf_tramp_image address emission."
