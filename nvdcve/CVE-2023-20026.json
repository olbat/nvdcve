This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device."
