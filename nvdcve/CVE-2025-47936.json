In versions on the 12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS, Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources (e.g., localhost or other services on the local network). While this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users should update to TYPO3 version 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem."
