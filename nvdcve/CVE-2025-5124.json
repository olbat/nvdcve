This affects an unknown part of the component Administrative Interface. The manipulation leads to use of default credentials. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. It is recommended to change the configuration settings. The vendor was contacted early about this issue. They confirmed the existence but pointed out that they \"have published the 'Hardening Guide' on the Web from July 2018 to January 2025 and have thoroughly informed customers of the recommendation to change their initial passwords\"."
