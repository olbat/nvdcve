In versions 2.8.0 and below, the lookup function accepts user addresses for account checking. However, the ActivityPub specification requires preventing access to localhost services in production. This library does not prevent localhost access, only checking for hosts that start with \"localhost\" and end with a port. Users can exploit this by creating servers that send GET requests with controlled host, path, and port parameters to query services on the instance's host or local network, enabling blind SSRF attacks. This is fixed in version 2.8.1."
