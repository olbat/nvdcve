          "value": "The Job Iteration API is an an extension for ActiveJob that make jobs interruptible and resumable Versions prior to 1.11.0 have an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the `CsvEnumerator` class. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the application is running, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system compromise. The issue is fixed in versions `1.11.0` and above. Users can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input in the `CsvEnumerator` class and ensuring that any file paths are properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the class methods. Users should avoid using the `count_of_rows_in_file` method with untrusted CSV filenames."
