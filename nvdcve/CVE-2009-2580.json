  "evaluatorImpact": "Per http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/259425\r\n\r\n\"Adobe Flash is a widely deployed multimedia platform typically used to provide content in web sites. Adobe Flash Player, Reader, Acrobat, and other Adobe products include Flash support.\r\n\r\nAdobe Flash Player contains a code execution vulnerability. An attacker may be able to trigger this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted Flash (SWF) file. The SWF file could be hosted or embedded in a web page or contained in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. If an attacker can take control of a website or web server, trusted sites may exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Adobe Flash versions 9.0.159.0 and 10.0.22.87 and earlier 9.x and 10.x versions. Adobe Reader 9, Acrobat 9, and other Adobe products (including Photoshop CS3, PhotoShop Lightroom, Freehand MX, Fireworks) provide Flash support independent of Flash Player. As of 2009-07-22, Adobe Reader 9.1.2 includes Flash 9.0.155.0, which is likely vulnerable to issues addressed by Flash 9.0.159.0 \""
