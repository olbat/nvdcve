The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks."
