      "value": "The PPOM â€“ Product Addons & Custom Fields for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the image cropper functionality in all versions up to, and including, 33.0.15. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. While the vulnerable code is in the free version, this only affected users with the paid version of the software installed and activated."
