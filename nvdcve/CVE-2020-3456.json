The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the FCM interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests that could take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user."
