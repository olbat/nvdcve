      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nslab: fix kmalloc_nolock() context check for PREEMPT_RT\n\nOn PREEMPT_RT kernels, local_lock becomes a sleeping lock. The current\ncheck in kmalloc_nolock() only verifies we're not in NMI or hard IRQ\ncontext, but misses the case where preemption is disabled.\n\nWhen a BPF program runs from a tracepoint with preemption disabled\n(preempt_count > 0), kmalloc_nolock() proceeds to call\nlocal_lock_irqsave() which attempts to acquire a sleeping lock,\ntriggering:\n\n  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context\n  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 6128\n  preempt_count: 2, expected: 0\n\nFix this by checking !preemptible() on PREEMPT_RT, which directly\nexpresses the constraint that we cannot take a sleeping lock when\npreemption is disabled. This encompasses the previous checks for NMI\nand hard IRQ contexts while also catching cases where preemption is\ndisabled."
