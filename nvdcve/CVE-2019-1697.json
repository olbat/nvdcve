The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted LDAP packet, using Basic Encoding Rules (BER), to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
