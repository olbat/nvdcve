Home Assistant server does not set any HTTP security headers, including the X-Frame-Options header, which specifies whether the web page is allowed to be framed. The omission of this and correlating headers facilitates covert clickjacking attacks and alternative exploit opportunities, such as the vector described in this security advisory. This fault incurs major risk, considering the ability to trick users into installing an external and malicious add-on with minimal user interaction, which would enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Home Assistant application. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
