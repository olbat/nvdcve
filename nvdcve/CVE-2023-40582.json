Versions prior to 1.0.3 did not properly escape user input and are vulnerable to Command Injection via an attacker controlled parameter. As a result, attackers may run malicious shell commands in the context of the running process. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.3. users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that all input passed to find-exec comes from a trusted source."
