This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of SMARTBEAR SoapUI. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the unpackageAll function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-19060."
