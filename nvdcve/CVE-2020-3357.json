The vulnerability exists because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
