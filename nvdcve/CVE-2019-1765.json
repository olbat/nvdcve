The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and file-level permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading invalid files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series."
