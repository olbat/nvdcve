To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain CLI commands that are executed on a vulnerable system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system and sending crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root."
