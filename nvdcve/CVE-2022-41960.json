An attacker can make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId, and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting verification failure is also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must be a participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. There are no workarounds."
