This vulnerability may allow for a malicious actor to impersonate an authorized SAML session if certificate-based authentication is enabled. This vulnerability is also relevant if certificate-based authentication is not enabled, but the outcome of exploitation is limited to an information disclosure (Important Severity) in those cases."
