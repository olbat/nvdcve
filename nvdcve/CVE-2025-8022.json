Each ${â€¦} interpolation is treated as a single argument. The security responsibility for this usage pattern lies with the calling application, which must ensure the sanitization and validation of any untrusted arguments before passing them to the executed commands. Therefore, the potential for command injection is not a flaw within Bun itself; rather, it is an argument injection that is contingent on its implementation by the consuming application."
