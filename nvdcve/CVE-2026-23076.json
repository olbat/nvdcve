      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: ctxfi: Fix potential OOB access in audio mixer handling\n\nIn the audio mixer handling code of ctxfi driver, the conf field is\nused as a kind of loop index, and it's referred in the index callbacks\n(amixer_index() and sum_index()).\n\nAs spotted recently by fuzzers, the current code causes OOB access at\nthose functions.\n| UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in /build/reproducible-path/linux-6.17.8/sound/pci/ctxfi/ctamixer.c:347:48\n| index 8 is out of range for type 'unsigned char [8]'\n\nAfter the analysis, the cause was found to be the lack of the proper\n(re-)initialization of conj field.\n\nThis patch addresses those OOB accesses by adding the proper\ninitializations of the loop indices."
