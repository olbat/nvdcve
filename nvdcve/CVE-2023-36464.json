That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced in pull request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` to `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\", b\"\")`."
