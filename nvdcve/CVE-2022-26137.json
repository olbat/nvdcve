          "value": "A vulnerability in multiple Atlassian products allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause additional Servlet Filters to be invoked when the application processes requests or responses. Atlassian has confirmed and fixed the only known security issue associated with this vulnerability: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) bypass. Sending a specially crafted HTTP request can invoke the Servlet Filter used to respond to CORS requests, resulting in a CORS bypass. An attacker that can trick a user into requesting a malicious URL can access the vulnerable application with the victimâ€™s permissions.
