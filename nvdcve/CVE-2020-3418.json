The vulnerability is due to an incomplete access control list (ACL) being applied prior to RUN state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the associated service set identifier (SSID) and sending ICMPv6 traffic. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send ICMPv6 traffic prior to RUN state."
