      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_path\n\nppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:\n\n1. The ppp->channels list can change between list_empty() and\n   list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel\n   is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may\n   access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.\n\n2. pch->chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,\n   pch->chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp->channels.\n\nFix these by using a lockless RCU approach:\n- Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list\n  entry.\n- Convert list modifications on ppp->channels to their RCU variants and\n  add synchronize_net() after removal.\n- Check for a NULL pch->chan before dereferencing it."
