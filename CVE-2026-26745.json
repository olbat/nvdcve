      "value": "OpenSourcePOS 3.4.1 has a second order SQL Injection vulnerability in the handling of the currency_symbol configuration field. Although the input is initially stored without immediate execution, it is later concatenated into a dynamically constructed SQL query without proper sanitization or parameter binding. This allows an attacker with access to modify the currency_symbol value to inject arbitrary SQL expressions, which are executed when the affected query is subsequently processed."
