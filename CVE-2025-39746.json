      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath10k: shutdown driver when hardware is unreliable\n\nIn rare cases, ath10k may lose connection with the PCIe bus due to\nsome unknown reasons, which could further lead to system crashes during\nresuming due to watchdog timeout:\n\nath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: wmi command 20486 timeout, restarting hardware\nath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: already restarting\nath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop WMI vdev 0: -11\nath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop vdev 0: -11\nieee80211 phy0: PM: **** DPM device timeout ****\nCall Trace:\n panic+0x125/0x315\n dpm_watchdog_set+0x54/0x54\n dpm_watchdog_handler+0x57/0x57\n call_timer_fn+0x31/0x13c\n\nAt this point, all WMI commands will timeout and attempt to restart\ndevice. So set a threshold for consecutive restart failures. If the\nthreshold is exceeded, consider the hardware is unreliable and all\nath10k operations should be skipped to avoid system crash.\n\nfail_cont_count and pending_recovery are atomic variables, and\ndo not involve complex conditional logic. Therefore, even if recovery\ncheck and reconfig complete are executed concurrently, the recovery\nmechanism will not be broken.\n\nTested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00288-QCARMSWPZ-1"
