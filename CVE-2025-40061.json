      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rxe: Fix race in do_task() when draining\n\nWhen do_task() exhausts its iteration budget (!ret), it sets the state\nto TASK_STATE_IDLE to reschedule, without a secondary check on the\ncurrent task->state. This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended."
