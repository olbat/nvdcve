The PDF converter function does not check if internal or external resources are requested in the uploaded files and allows for protocols such as http:// and file:///. This allows an attacker to upload an XML or HTML file in the application, which when rendered to a PDF allows for internal port scanning and Local File Inclusion (LFI)."
