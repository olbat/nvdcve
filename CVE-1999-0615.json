  "evaluatorSolution": "SNMPv3 is a secure protocol for management of networked systems, provided the cryptographic security mechanisms are used.  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 are unsecured protocols for Internet facing systems and should  only be used on a trusted network segment.  For all versions, the software should be patched and configured properly.",
  "evaluatorImpact": "This Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry is a configuration issue and not a software flaw. As such, it doesnâ€™t fit in the CVE software flaw list. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for this CVE entry has been set to 0 because this CVE entry has no impact as a software flaw according to CVSS. This does not mean that the configuration issue is not important and there may be security implications relative to computers having this configuration."
