  "evaluatorSolution": "The Echo Service is an unsecured and obsolete protocol and it should be disabled.  Historically it has been used to perform denial of service attacks.",
  "evaluatorImpact": "This Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry is a configuration issue and not a software flaw. As such, it doesnâ€™t fit in the CVE software flaw list. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for this CVE entry has been set to 0 because this CVE entry has no impact as a software flaw according to CVSS. This does not mean that the configuration issue is not important and there may be security implications relative to computers having this configuration."
