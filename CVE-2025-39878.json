      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error\n\nThe function move_dirty_folio_in_page_array() was created by commit\nce80b76dd327 (\"ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method\") by\nmoving code from ceph_writepages_start() to this function.\n\nThis new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked\nby the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the\ncaller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the\nloop.\n\nHowever, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it\nalways returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and\nthen returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are\nsilently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may\nlater crash the kernel.\n\nThe simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer."
